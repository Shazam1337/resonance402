# RESONANCE₄₀₂ — The Social Liquidity Engine

A dynamic platform that shows how social activity (posts, mentions, hashtags, memes) influences trading volume growth and platform fees in the Solana network. Every user action is an impulse that strengthens the network and increases Vault₄₀₂.

## Concept: Social Activity → Trading Volume → Platform Fees

The platform demonstrates the causal relationship:

**Social Activity** (posts, mentions, hashtags) → **Trading Volume Growth** → **Platform Fees** → **Vault₄₀₂ Growth**

- **Vault₄₀₂** = Platform fees accumulated in SOL, constantly growing in real-time
- **Energy Flow** = Live trading volume (SOL) with real-time updates
- **Social Waves₄₀₂** = Active social campaigns impacting trading volume
- **Active Nodes** = Connected users/wallets participating in the network
- **Resonance Index** = Network health indicator combining activity, volume, and Vault growth

Everything is visualized as a living organism where all elements move, update, and grow continuously.

## Core Principles

- **Constant Growth** — Vault₄₀₂ constantly grows, reflecting real-time fee accumulation
- **Live Updates** — All numbers, graphs, and feeds update continuously (every 1-5 seconds)
- **Living Interface** — Elements breathe, pulse, and react to network activity
- **Causal Visualization** — Clear cause-and-effect: Social Wave → Volume → Fees → Vault
- **Dynamic Movement** — Everything moves, updates, and grows without page reloads

## Features

- **Vault₄₀₂** — Central element showing platform fees in SOL, constantly growing with visual flash effects on growth
- **Energy Flow** — Live trading volume chart (SOL) with real-time updates every 2-3 seconds
- **Social Waves₄₀₂** — Live feed of active social campaigns with impact metrics (Volume Growth %, SOL Impact, Social Resonance %)
- **Active Nodes** — Real-time counter of connected users with growth tracking
- **Network Resonance Index** — Oscillating network health indicator (Hz)
- **Recent Transactions/Signals** — Scrolling feed of vault fees, wave impacts, and node signals (new entries every 3-5 seconds)
- **Rewards Zone** — Live display of participant rewards, constantly updating
